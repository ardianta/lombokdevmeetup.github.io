description: "Lombok Dev Meetup #3 will be held in a Tech Talk formatâ€”30 to 60 minute presentations that explore technical topics in more depth than lightning talks, but still without requiring hands-on participation. The event continues the enthusiasm from the first two meetups and aims to bring IT practitioners in Lombok together to share knowledge, foster collaboration, and strengthen local IT communities. Target participants include students, developers, engineers, programmers, sysadmins, and anyone interested in IT."
