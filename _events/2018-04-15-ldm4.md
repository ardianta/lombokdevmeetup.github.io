description: "LombokDev Meetup #4 – Tech Talk<br>This meetup adopts the Tech Talk format, featuring 30–60 minute presentations that explore technical topics in greater depth than lightning talks, but still without requiring hands-on participation. The event will run for 2 hours (excluding breaks), with up to 3 speakers each given a 40-minute slot including Q&A. An additional 30 minutes is reserved for flexibility, allowing speakers to request a few extra minutes in advance. In total, the session may run up to 2.5 hours, ensuring a balance of in-depth discussion and interactive exchange."
